Add 'b' hotkey to open a modal for managing blocking relationships.

Modal features:
- Shows list of all tickets (filterable)
- Space toggles selection (multi-select)
- Enter confirms selection
- Esc cancels
- '/' opens text filter input

Selected tickets become the 'blocking' list for the current ticket.
