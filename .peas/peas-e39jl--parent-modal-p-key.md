Add 'p' hotkey to open a modal for setting the parent relationship.

Modal features:
- Shows list of valid parent tickets (milestones, epics)
- Single-select only (unlike blocking)
- Space or Enter selects and confirms
- Esc cancels
- '/' opens text filter input

Selected ticket becomes the parent of the current ticket.
