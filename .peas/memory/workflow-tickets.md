Always create tickets FIRST before starting work on a feature or fix. The workflow is:

1. Create ticket with description of what needs to be done
2. Work on the implementation
3. Update ticket status to completed when done
4. Reference ticket ID in commits/PRs if applicable

This ensures proper tracking and documentation of all changes.
