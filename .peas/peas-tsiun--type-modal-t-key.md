Change 't' hotkey from 'toggle view' to open a type selection modal.

Modal shows type options:
- Milestone
- Epic
- Story
- Feature
- Bug
- Chore
- Research
- Task

Current behavior: 't' toggles list/tree view
New behavior: 't' opens modal to change ticket type

View toggle should move to a different key (suggestion: 'v' for view)

Applies to selected ticket(s) if multi-select is active.
