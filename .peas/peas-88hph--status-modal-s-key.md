Change 's' hotkey from 'start' to open a status selection modal.

Modal shows status options:
- Draft
- Todo
- In Progress
- Completed
- Scrapped

Current behavior: 's' sets status to in-progress
New behavior: 's' opens modal to select any status

Applies to selected ticket(s) if multi-select is active.
