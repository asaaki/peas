Change the selection indicator from full-row highlight to a vertical bar (▌) at the start of the line.

Current: The entire selected row is highlighted with a background color
New: Show a vertical bar character (▌) at the start of the selected line, no background highlight

This is cleaner and matches the beans TUI style. The bar should be colored (e.g., cyan or green) to stand out.
