# Agent Rules

**IMPORTANT**: When you're on Windows, prefer powershell (pwsh) over bash if possible!

**IMPORTANT**: before you do anything else, run the `peas prime` command and heed its output. (Since this is the peas project itself, you need to call it with `cargo run -- <command and args>` instead.)
